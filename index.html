		  	I am currently a <b>sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University</b>. Going into college I was sure that I wanted to get a degree in biology because I extremely enjoyed learning about it in high school. However, it only took one semester of computer science in college to sell me on a completely different path. I am now a <b>Computer Science major with a minor in Robotics</b>.
		  	<br>
		  	<br>
		  	One of the reasons that I love computer science is because it allows me to quickly teach myself how to build cool things. I am currently proficient in these technologies: <b>Python, C, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Django, SQL/NOSQL</b>
		  	<br>
		  	<br>
		  	Some of the courses I have taken include:<br>
		  	- 15-112 Fundamentals of Programming<br>
		  	- 15-122 Principles of Imperative Computation<br>
		  	- 21-127 Concepts of Mathematics<br>
		  	- 15-150 Functional Programming<br>
		  	- 15-214 Principles of Software System Construction<br>
		  	- 15-251 Great Theoretical Ideas in Computer Science<br>
